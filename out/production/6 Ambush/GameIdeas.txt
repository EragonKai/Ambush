Ambush (name can be changed later if desired)

A game in which you explore through a "dungeon" with multiple rooms.
Each scene can have a different objective and possible danger. Can also be randomly generated.

	- Practice making a menu and using a variable to have different input/drawings and stuff
	- Use an input class that gets called whenever keyListener/mouseListener detects something (for neatness)
	- Use a 2d array to have a room layout that can later be randomly created
	- Create a starting inventory/hud to expand on later
	- Use an abstract class room to create different layouts


Priority:
    1-Set up basic classes/JPanel (Screen, Runner)
    2-Create two classes: Input and Draw. Input handles input for neatness, and Draw is used to load all images
    3-Draw a player with 2 animation sets and get walking working correctly
    4-Draw a placeholder menu and get button clicking working to enter the game. Can use an enum
    5-Create a superclass "Room" with several basic properties (possible abstract? idk)
    6-Draw a basic starting room floor tile and wall tile and get those to load correctly
    7-Get wall collisions working with an arrayList to allow for future obstacles
    8-Create a class that has an array of rooms it can load
    9-Remove collisions/drawn walls if the player has completed the room(i.e. wall no longer loads based on that side in the array)
    10-Create a HUD on the right (with health, etc) with enough space for any future ideas (items, map button, etc)
    11-Let the player move between rooms on the map (create placeHolder rooms for this to happen
    12-Add shooting with basic projectiles (use a separate weapon class that the player can draw from)
    13-Create an enemy superclass with basic stats
    14-Maybe create an enemy handler class similar to what I did in mine wave? or put that code into the room handler
    15-Get collisions working between player projectiles and enemies
    16-Add projectile enemy superclass
    17-get loot on the ground working and equippable, and be able to view the items stats
    18-Get player stats displayed and working, with items affecting them
    19-Create more rooms/enemies/weapons, basically just CONTENT
    20-add a map
    21-add an inventory that works
    22-Make the roomArray randomly generated
    23-Think of more ideas (armor, levels, animations for attacks, more content in general, etc)

7/28 Goals:
    Created BlueRoomT5, BlueConstruct, SnowBlaze

Basic Item Concept:
    Similar to realm, don't know xmls atm so will just create a package with a ton of classes
    Main differences will be how they affect stats + # of bullets and damage/size/speed
    each item will be 32x32 (?)
    Maybe have an inventory
    Possibly only weapons, maybe add armor later
    Items could have different passive effects (coding this would probably be messy)

    notes 7/26:
    make it so that whenever a room is completed it replaces the threat level in the array with that instance of the room so you can go back to it
    need to create a list in the room class that keeps track of items in the currentRoom
    whenever user presses e it switches a gun within x pixels of the user with the slot
