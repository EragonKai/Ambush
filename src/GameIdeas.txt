Ambush (name can be changed later if desired)

A game in which you explore through a "dungeon" with multiple rooms.
Each scene can have a different objective and possible danger. Can also be randomly generated.

	- Practice making a menu and using a variable to have different input/drawings and stuff
	- Use an input class that gets called whenever keyListener/mouseListener detects something (for neatness)
	- Use a 2d array to have a room layout that can later be randomly created
	- Create a starting inventory/hud to expand on later
	- Use an abstract class room to create different layouts


Priority:
    1-Set up basic classes/JPanel (Screen, Runner)
    2-Create two classes: Input and Draw. Input handles input for neatness, and Draw is used to load all images
    3-Draw a player with 2 animation sets and get walking working correctly
    4-Draw a placeholder menu and get button clicking working to enter the game. Can use an enum
    5-Create a superclass "Room" with several basic properties (possible abstract? idk)
    6-Draw a basic starting room floor tile and wall tile and get those to load correctly
    7-Get wall collisions working with an arrayList to allow for future obstacles
    8-Create a class that has an array of rooms it can load
    9-Remove collisions/drawn walls if the player has completed the room(i.e. wall no longer loads based on that side in the array)
    10-Create a HUD on the right (with health, etc) with enough space for any future ideas (items, map button, etc)
    11-Let the player move between rooms on the map (create placeHolder rooms for this to happen
    12-Add shooting with basic projectiles (use a separate weapon class that the player can draw from)
    13-Create an enemy superclass with basic stats
    14-Maybe create an enemy handler class similar to what I did in mine wave? or put that code into the room handler
    15-Get collisions working between player projectiles and enemies
    16-Add projectile enemy superclass
    17-get loot on the ground working and equippable, and be able to view the items stats
    18-Get player stats displayed and working, with items affecting them
    19-Create more rooms/enemies/weapons, basically just CONTENT
    20-add a map
    21-Make the roomArray randomly generated
    22-add a deathScreen and score, as well as a restart button
    23-reduce effectiveness of stats and then add potion drops with a max stat cap
    23-Make the rooms not respawn
    24-minimap, make you only able to see rooms next to you, color coded
    25-add an inventory that works
    26-Think of more ideas (armor, levels, animations for attacks, more content in general, etc)

room 7 idea: a bunch of fragile projectile dudes who shoot pretty slow but on death release a super fast dude who rushes you with a decent amount of health
